# rogue-composer
This is a game for the 2025 Cambridge Game Jam.
The theme is Synesthesia.

In this platformer game, the player will compose a piece
which controls the composer. When the player clicks play,
the composer will take out actions in correspondence with the piece.

This game is a 2d platformer game with combat.

The goal of each level is to get the composer to jump
to the end of the level and grab the apple (go to the next level), 
while killing or avoiding any enemies along the way.

action that the composer can take.
A -> walk right
B -> walk left
C -> small jump
