# Rogue Composer

In this platformer game, the player will compose a piece
which controls the composer. When the player clicks play,
the composer will take out actions in correspondance with the piece.

This game is a 2d platformer game with combat.

The goal of each level is to get the composer to jump
to the end of the level, while killing or avoiding any enemies along the way.

Here is the correspondance between the piece of music and the actions of the composer

a -> go right
b -> go left
c -> small jump
d -> big jump
e -> block
f -> parry
g -> stab
